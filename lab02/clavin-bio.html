    I am an advertising major with an emphasis in digital advertising. I have worked in <strong>social media marketing</strong> for local businesses and fast-service brands franchises. Along with this, I have worked on micro-influencer campaigns for national brands such as Blaze Pizza, KFC, and Wendyâ€™s. These campaigns have reached over 2 million impressions with hundreds of micro-influencers. Social media is not my only forte, I also enjoy skiing, long walks on the beach, and chai tea.
