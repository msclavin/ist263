    <p>
        We guarantee you will not find the variety that we offer anywhere else. Our traditional cookie trays contain over twenty-five different kinds of cookies and biscotti--all made from scratch from different doughs with their own special flavors. 
    </p>

    <img src="../project/project-images/Screen Shot 2021-11-07 at 9.25.01 PM.png" alt="assorted cookies">

    <p>
        We do NOT make one dough and shape it 25 different ways! There are about twenty-eight cookies per pound; we make them small so our guests can eat as many as they'd like. We recommend 1 1/2-pound trays for tables of 10 or more. Ask about our cookie favors, gift boxes, and individual servings! Our products are very customizable, and we are happy to work within your budget.
